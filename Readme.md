# DroneRaceView

Race view is a small ad-hoc website designed to take data directly from [RotorHazard](https://rotorhazard.com/) timing system and vizualise it in a way accessible to anyone with internet connection.
It is intended to be race-format-specific meaning that it may show information about progression of the race according to its format.
But the flip side of the coin is that a timer setup has to match what is expected by the RaceView

## Showcase
